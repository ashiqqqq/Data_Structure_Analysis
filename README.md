Compared and analyzed various Models to identify which fits the Facebook date best. 
These models include; Erdos-Renyi Model, Watts Strogatz model, Barabasi-Albert Model, Triangle Friends Model and the Mediation-Driven Attachment Model. 
We also stimulated an SIR model with the best fitted model from above the found the most optimal parameters of the model using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
